This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: using an uninitialized pointer. The code attempts to dereference a pointer before assigning it a valid memory address. This is undefined behavior that can result in crashes, incorrect output, or seemingly random behavior. The solution demonstrates how to correctly initialize the pointer before dereferencing it.
